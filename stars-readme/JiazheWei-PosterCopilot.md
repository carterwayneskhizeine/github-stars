### ✨ Core Features

- **🎯 Geometrically Accurate Layouts**  
  Achieves precise spatial positioning through a progressive three-stage training strategy that moves beyond simple regression to distribution-based learning

- **🎨 Aesthetic Reasoning**  
  Instills human-like design principles and aesthetics through reinforcement learning from aesthetic feedback

- **✂️ Layer-level Control**  
  Enables precise, fine-grained editing of individual layers while maintaining global visual consistency

- **🔄 Multi-round Iterative Editing**  
  Supports professional iterative design workflows with multiple refinement rounds on specific elements

- **🎭 Versatile Applications**  
  Handles complete layout generation, insufficient assets synthesis, theme switching, and canvas reframing

### 📈 Three-Stage Training Paradigm

1. **Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning (PSFT)**  
   Reformulates coordinate regression into distribution-based learning for continuous spatial reasoning

2. **Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment (RL-VRA)**  
   Introduces geometric reward signals to ensure visual-reality alignment and spatial accuracy

3. **Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback (RLAF)**  
   Employs learned aesthetic rewards to generate coherent and diverse compositions

### 📊 PosterCopilot Dataset

**One of the largest-scale, most thematically diverse, and highest-quality multi-layer poster datasets.**

- **160K posters** with **2.6M layers** (1.2M text + 1.4M image/decorative elements)
- Spans **40+ distinct domains** from commercial promotions to public announcements
- Novel OCR-based pipeline addresses over-segmentation challenges in multi-layer datasets
