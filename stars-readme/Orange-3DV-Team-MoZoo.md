**TL;DR:** MoZoo synthesizes high-fidelity animal dynamics from coarse meshes using Role-Aware RoPE and Asymmetric Decoupled Attention, achieving superior fur and muscle simulation across diverse species.

## 📖 Abstract

The creation of cinematic-quality animal effects necessitates the precise modeling of muscle and fur dynamics, a process that remains both labor-intensive and computationally expensive within traditional production workflows. While generative diffusion models have shown promise in diverse artistic workflows, their capacity for high-fidelity animal simulation remains largely unexploited. We present <strong>MoZoo</strong>, a generative dynamics solver that bypasses conventional refinement to synthesize high-fidelity animal videos from coarse meshes under multimodal guidance. We propose <strong>Role-Aware RoPE (RAR-RoPE)</strong> which employs role-based index remapping to synchronize motion alignment while decoupling reference information via fixed temporal offsets. Complementing this, <strong>Asymmetric Decoupled Attention</strong> partitions the latent sequence to enforce a unidirectional information flow, effectively preventing feature interference and improving computational efficiency. To address the scarcity of high-quality training data, we introduce <strong>MoZoo-Data</strong>, a synthetic-to-real pipeline that leverages a rendering engine and an inverse mapping approach to construct a large-scale dataset of paired sequences. Furthermore, we establish <strong>MoZooBench</strong>, a comprehensive benchmark with 120 mesh-video pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that <strong>MoZoo</strong> achieves high-fidelity fur simulation across diverse animal skeletons and layouts, preserving superior temporal and structural consistency.
