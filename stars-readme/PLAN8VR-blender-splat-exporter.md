# blender-splat-exporter
Blender addon (windows) that exports synthetic Gaussian Splat .ply from mesh geometry using either direct .ply write, or by using Playcanvas' Splat-Transform. Currently works with vertex colours.
Addon can also export the .mjs file for future use/editing with Splat-Transform. 



Dependency - Splat Transform

 https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform - install as per instructions 

Install Blender addon (blender_splat_export.py) the usual way.

Ensure the mesh has an active colour attribute assigned and that vertex colours have been baked or created. (Also works with Principled BSDF base colour)

Select mesh to export, use the options in 3D view tool side panel. 

Choose between .ply and .SOG export format 

Currently, there are two options for Points~|~Splats, use the existing vertices (most stable and predictable), 
or sample mesh (less stable and not very optimised just yet). This will be replaced with a geometry node setup soon - for now I advise not using this option, but may be ok for low poly counts.

There is a slider for global opacity and size of splat, and an autosize splats option based on neareast point relative proximity (Be sure to apply any object scaling as it effects the autoscale results). 
The transparency value is calculated from the colour attribute's alpha channel. 

These values (and all blender animations) can be keyframed (i shortcut key) and all animations can be exported as individual ply/sog frames in one batch, (numbered with keyframe if selected) for 4DGS sequences.
