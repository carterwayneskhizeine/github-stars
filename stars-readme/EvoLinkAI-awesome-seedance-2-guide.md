## ✨ Why Seedance 2.0?

Supports **image + video + audio + text** four modalities as simultaneous input. Use `@material_name` in natural language to describe the effect you want, and the model understands. It's not just "generation," but true controllable creation.

### Case 2 · Creative Narrative — Cola Advertisement

**Input:** 1 reference image + text

```
The character in the painting has a guilty expression, eyes glancing left and right as they peek out of the frame, quickly reaching out to grab a cola and take a sip, then showing a satisfied expression. Suddenly footsteps are heard, the character quickly puts the cola back in place. A western cowboy picks up the cup with cola and walks away. Finally, the camera pushes forward and the scene slowly becomes a pure black background with only top lighting illuminating the canned cola. At the bottom of the frame, artistic subtitles and voiceover appear: "Yikou Cola, a must-try!"

| Image | jpeg, png, webp, bmp, tiff, gif | ≤ 9 | Single < 30MB | — |
| Video | mp4, mov | ≤ 3 | Single < 50MB | Total 2-15s |
| Audio | mp3, wav | ≤ 3 | Single < 15MB | Total ≤ 15s |
| Text | Natural language | — | — | — |

**Combined Limit:** Total ≤ 12 files (images + videos + audio combined)

**Output Specifications:** Generated duration 4-15s freely selectable, video up to 720p, includes sound effects/background music

> **Compliance Note:** Currently does not support uploading materials containing realistic human faces. Recommend using illustration style, AI-generated virtual characters, animals, products, scenes, etc.

---

## 🎮 Interaction Method

Use `@material_name` in the prompt to specify the role of each material. Upload order is the numbering order:

```
@image1 as the first frame, @video1 as reference for camera language, @audio1 for background music
```

| Entry Point | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **First/Last Frame** | Upload only first frame (or first + last frame) + prompt |
| **All-in-One Reference** | Multimodal combination input (image + video + audio + text) |

**Common Writing Patterns:**

```
# Specify first frame
Use @image1 as the first frame of the scene, ...

# Reference camera movement only, not character
Reference all camera movement effects from @video1, but use the character appearance from @image1

# Separate action and camera movement references
Reference character action from @video1, reference circular camera movement from @video2

# Video extension (generated duration = new seconds, not total duration)
Extend @video1 by 5s, [content description]

# Reference video sound effects
Background BGM references sound effects from @video1
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Techniques

**Prompt Writing**

- Long videos (10s+) use timeline segmentation: `0-3s: [description] / 3-6s: [description]`
- Actions/emotions must be specific: ❌ `character is very sad` → ✅ `tears slide down cheeks, mouth trembles slightly`
- One-shot must end with: `No scene cuts throughout, one continuous shot.`

**Keyword-Triggered Effects**

| Desired Effect | Recommended Writing |
|------------|----------|
| Hitchcock zoom | `protagonist in panic with Hitchcock zoom` |
| Circular camera | `robotic arm multi-angle circular movement` |
| Accelerating speed | `speed accelerates like a roller coaster` |
| Particle effects | `golden sand particles scatter` / `particle dispersion effect` |

**Multimodal Combination Strategy**

| Dimension You Want to Control | Material to Use |
|----------------|------------|
| Character appearance | Image (multiple angles) |
| Camera movement | Video (reference camera language) |
| Action | Video (reference action) |
| Voice/tone | Video (reference video with dialogue) |
| Background music rhythm | Video or audio |
| Scene style | Image (scene reference) |

**Common Issues**

- **Reference video didn't replicate camera movement?** → Add `completely reference all camera movement effects from @video1`
- **Character appearance inconsistent?** → Upload multi-angle images, add to prompt `maintain character appearance exactly consistent with @image1`
- **Video extension seams unnatural?** → Start extension prompt describing the state of the last frame of original video

## 📝 Prompt Templates

**Product 360 Showcase**

@image1 [product name] as the main subject, camera movement references @video1, zoom in to close-up of [specific part],

surrounding environment [atmosphere description]
```

**Advertisement Comparison**
```
This is a [product] advertisement, @image1 as the first frame, [character A] in [state A, e.g.: elegant],
camera quickly pans right, shooting @image2 [character B] [state B, e.g.: disheveled],
camera pans left and zooms in shooting [product], [product] references @image3, [product] in [working state].
```

**Video Extension Script**
```
[N]s
Extend @video1 [forward/backward] by [N] seconds.
[0-X]s: [scene description].
[X-Y]s: [scene description].
[Y-N]s: [ending scene/subtitles].
```

**One Continuous Shot**
```
@image1@image2@image3..., [perspective] one continuous shot [movement type] camera,
[movement trajectory: from A through B to C], [speed/rhythm changes].
