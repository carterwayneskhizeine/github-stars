# Real-time Mediapipe-based FLAME Animation Driver

Mapping **Mediapipe**'s 52 blendshapes to **FLAME**'s 100 expression coefficients and poses (jaw and eyeballs).

This can be used to drive the FLAME mesh using Mediapipe in **real-time**.

> [!NOTE]
> I used FLAME 2020 in this project, to use my mappings, please ensure that you are using FLAME 2020.

**Updates**:
- Sept. 26, 2025: Use flame-head-tracker v4.1 to prepare training data. Training data from PointAvatar dataset and INSTA dataset.
- March 21, 2025: Use all 100 FLAME expression coefficients, instead of the first 50 coefficients. 

## Flame-Head-Tracker
- This code is part of ```flame-head-tracker```: https://github.com/PeizhiYan/flame-head-tracker


## 🔑 Method

We use both public datasets (NerSemble, IMAvatar) and our own data. First, we estimate the FLAME model coefficients (expression, pose, and eye pose) along with Mediapipe blendshape scores for each image. We then compute the linear mappings using [```./compute_mappings.ipynb```](./compute_mappings.ipynb).

## 🧸 How to Use

### Convert Mediapipe blendshapes to FLAME coefficients (expression, pose, and eye pose)
```python
from mp_2_flame import MP_2_FLAME
mp2flame = MP_2_FLAME(mappings_path='./mappings')

# blendshape_scores is the np.array object with shape [N,52],
# N is the number of samples, and by default N=1
exp, pose, eye_pose = mp2flame.convert(blendshape_scores=blendshape_scores)
```

### Estimate Head Pose
```python
from mp_2_flame import compute_head_pose_from_mp_landmarks_3d


# download model weights from: https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task
base_options = python.BaseOptions(model_asset_path='face_landmarker.task')
options = vision.FaceLandmarkerOptions(base_options=base_options,
                                        output_face_blendshapes=True,
                                        output_facial_transformation_matrixes=True,
                                        num_faces=1)
mediapipe_detector = vision.FaceLandmarker.create_from_options(options)

# assume img is an RGB image
img_h, img_w, img_c = img.shape
image = mp.Image(image_format=mp.ImageFormat.SRGB, data=img) # convert numpy image to Mediapipe Image

detection_result = mediapipe_detector.detect(image)

if len(detection_result.face_blendshapes) > 0:
    img_h = img.shape[0]
    img_w = img.shape[1]
    lmks_3d = detection_result.face_landmarks[0]
    lmks_3d = np.array(list(map(lambda l: np.array([l.x, l.y, l.z]), lmks_3d))) # [478, 3]
    lmks_3d[:, 0] = lmks_3d[:, 0] * img_w
    lmks_3d[:, 1] = lmks_3d[:, 1] * img_h

    # estimate the head pose
    rotation_vec, translation_vec = compute_head_pose_from_mp_landmarks_3d(face_landmarks=lmks_3d, img_h=img_h, img_w=img_w)
    print(rotation_vec, translation_vec)

```

## (Optional) Use Your Own Data to Compute the Mappings

1) Prepare the monocular vidoes, and use ```flame-head-tracker v4.1``` (https://github.com/PeizhiYan/flame-head-tracker) track the videos.
2) Use ```gather_data.ipynb``` to gather the tracked data and save to ```.npy``` files.
3) Use ```compute_mappings.ipynb``` to compute the blandshape-to-flame mappings, and save the mappings to ```.npy``` files.
