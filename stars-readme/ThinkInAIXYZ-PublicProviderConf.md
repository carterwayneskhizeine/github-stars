# PublicProviderConf

PublicProviderConf is a TypeScript CLI and library that aggregates the canonical [models.dev catalog](https://models.dev/api.json) together with several custom provider integrations (PPInfra, TokenFlux, Groq, Qiniu-hosted snapshots, and others). The tool normalizes capabilities, fills in missing metadata, and emits standardized JSON payloads that downstream apps can consume without bespoke adapters.

## Highlights
- Unified JSON schema for every provider with consistent capability flags
- Concurrent fetcher pipeline that merges live APIs with maintained templates
- Configurable CLI built with Commander + Vite for both dev (ts-node) and production builds
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow that can publish fresh `dist/` artifacts and sync them to CDN storage

## Data Sources & Coverage
The aggregated dataset starts with the upstream `https://models.dev/api.json`. During each run we overlay:
- Provider overrides from `manual-templates/`
- Live fetchers for operators that are not (yet) covered by models.dev, such as `ppinfra`, `tokenflux`, and `groq`
- Lightweight snapshots for ecosystems like `ollama` and `siliconflow`

After post-processing, the CLI writes the final catalog to `dist/`. Key outputs include:
- `dist/all.json` – aggregated providers, model counts, and capability rollups
- `dist/{provider}.json` – normalized payload for each individual provider

Consumers can point CDN tooling at the `dist/` directory (see GitHub Actions workflow) to publish the latest data for public access.

## Extended Capability Fields
The dataset keeps legacy capability fields unchanged for backward compatibility. Existing fields such as `reasoning`, `reasoning_effort`, and `interleaved` are preserved as-is.

When we need richer model-level metadata, we add it under `extra_capabilities` instead of changing old fields. The first supported extension is `extra_capabilities.reasoning`, which represents a fixed reasoning portrait for the model itself.

### Design Rules
- `extra_capabilities.reasoning` describes the model portrait, not provider-specific parameter exposure
- The same model should have the same reasoning portrait across providers whenever possible
- If a model is not covered by the portrait registry, `extra_capabilities.reasoning` is omitted
- Legacy fields remain the compatibility layer for downstream consumers that already depend on them
- Legacy `reasoning.supported` is the compatibility signal that a model supports reasoning; provider-specific controls such as `effort` may still depend on the current provider surface
- `visibility` is a normalized output-visibility field, not a provider-native parameter name such as Anthropic's `thinking.display`
- `omitted` is distinct from `hidden`: `omitted` tracks Anthropic's omitted thinking display, while `hidden` remains the generic non-exposed visibility bucket used by other providers
- Portrait defaults may intentionally differ from an upstream provider's raw default when we choose a better client-side starting point for a supported reasoning model

### Example
```json
{
  "id": "claude-opus-4.7",
  "reasoning": {
    "supported": true,
    "default": false
  },
  "extra_capabilities": {
    "reasoning": {
      "supported": true,
      "default_enabled": false,
      "mode": "effort",
      "effort": "high",
      "effort_options": ["low", "medium", "high", "xhigh", "max"],
      "interleaved": true,
      "summaries": true,
      "visibility": "omitted",
      "continuation": ["thinking_blocks"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `extra_capabilities.reasoning` Fields
- `supported`: whether the model family supports reasoning
- `default_enabled`: whether reasoning should be enabled by default in the model portrait
- `mode`: one of `budget`, `effort`, `level`, `fixed`, or `mixed`
- `budget`: token-budget style reasoning controls such as min/max/default/auto/off
- `effort`: default reasoning effort for this portrait, which may be a client-friendly default rather than the upstream provider's raw default
- `effort_options`: supported effort levels
- `verbosity`: default reasoning verbosity
- `verbosity_options`: supported verbosity levels
- `level`: default reasoning level for models that use level-based controls
- `level_options`: supported reasoning levels
- `interleaved`: whether interleaved reasoning is part of the model portrait
- `summaries`: whether reasoning summaries are part of the model portrait
- `visibility`: one of `hidden`, `summary`, `full`, `mixed`, or `omitted`; normalized across providers rather than mirroring vendor-native parameter names
- `continuation`: continuation mechanism hints such as `thinking_blocks` or `thought_signatures`
- `notes`: short implementation notes when the model family has important quirks

### Current Coverage
The initial portrait registry covers these model families:
- OpenAI: `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.1`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, and close variants/aliases
- Anthropic: Claude 3.7, Claude 4.x manual/adaptive thinking, and Claude Fable/Mythos effort portraits
- Google: Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 reasoning-capable models
- MiniMax: MiniMax M2.7 and MiniMax M2.7 highspeed interleaved reasoning portraits

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+

### Install & Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/PublicProviderConf.git
cd PublicProviderConf
pnpm install
pnpm build
```
`pnpm build` runs both Vite targets: the library bundle under `build/` and the bundled CLI at `build/cli.js`.

## CLI Usage

### Development Flow
```bash
pnpm run dev                 # ts-node, defaults to fetch-all
ts-node src/cli.ts fetch-all # explicit command
ts-node src/cli.ts fetch-providers -p ppinfra,tokenflux
```

### Production / Bundled CLI
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start                              # equivalent to node build/cli.js fetch-all
node build/cli.js fetch-providers -p ppinfra,tokenflux -o ./dist
```

### Global Installation (optional)
```bash
pnpm install -g .
public-provider-conf fetch-all
public-provider-conf fetch-providers -p ppinfra,tokenflux
```

### Command Reference
```bash
public-provider-conf fetch-all [options]
public-provider-conf fetch-providers -p <providers> [options]

Options:
  -p, --providers <providers>  Comma-separated provider IDs
  -o, --output <dir>           Output directory (default: dist)
  -h, --help                   Show command help
```

## Supported Providers
- models.dev catalog (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google Gemini, Vercel, GitHub Models, DeepSeek, etc.)
- PPInfra (live API)
- TokenFlux (marketplace API)
- Groq (requires `GROQ_API_KEY`)
- AIHubMix (live API)
- BurnCloud (manual template)
- Ollama (snapshot templates)
- SiliconFlow (snapshot templates)

Adding a new provider usually involves implementing `Provider` under `src/providers/`, adding configuration to `src/config/app-config.ts`, and optionally contributing templates to `manual-templates/`.
AIHubMix is fetched live from `https://aihubmix.com/api/v1/models` so you have a ready-made fallback dataset for models that aren't yet covered by the primary `models.dev` catalog. Keeping the provider enabled ensures `dist/aihubmix.json` stays current without manual snapshots.
BurnCloud rides exclusively on `manual-templates/burncloud.json`, which is regenerated from `models.txt` snapshots so the CLI can ship the latest catalog without hitting proprietary endpoints. Keep that template up to date (and re-run `jq -c` to refresh `dist/burncloud.json`) whenever BurnCloud publishes new models or capability metadata.

## Project Structure
```
src/
├─ cli.ts                 # CLI entry point (Commander)
├─ commands/              # fetch-all, fetch-providers commands
├─ config/                # default configuration and loaders
├─ fetcher/               # HTTP + file-based fetch orchestrators
├─ models/                # Type definitions and helpers
├─ output/                # Writers, validators, distribution helpers
└─ providers/             # Individual provider integrations
```

## Configuration & Environment
- Default endpoints and flags live in `src/config/app-config.ts`
- Override the models.dev endpoint with `MODELS_DEV_API_URL`
- Provide an offline fallback snapshot via `MODELS_DEV_SNAPSHOT_PATH`
- Set API secrets (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`) in your environment or CI secrets

## Development Tips
```bash
pnpm install      # install deps
pnpm run dev      # ts-node dev loop
pnpm build        # Vite builds (library + CLI)
pnpm start        # run bundled CLI
```
Use `DEBUG=true` when you need verbose fetcher logs.

## CI & Distribution
The `.github/workflows/fetch-models.yml` workflow builds the project, runs the fetch pipeline, validates JSON output, and can sync the `dist/` directory to a Qiniu CDN bucket for distribution. Ensure the Qiniu credentials are available as repository secrets when enabling the CDN path.
